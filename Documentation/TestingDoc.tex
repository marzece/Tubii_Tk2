\begin{itemize}
\item Make Testing Document
\end{itemize}
\section{Powers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use multimeter check that there are no shorts between the various powers.
(VCC,GND,V3P3,VEE,VTT,VCCIO,V15,V15M)
\item Plug in the board to each power if they're availible
\item Test regulators (note the VCCIO regulators output should be 0V until the 
enable pin is used) (Or maybe on second thought the output will be 3.3V when b/c the
enable pin is disconnected,I'm not sure, but you can test that the output turns on/ off when the enable pin is low/high)
\end{itemize}
\section{MicroZed}
\begin{itemize}
\item Stuff the lv06a that will control the VCCIO regulator. Then stuff and plug in the MicroZed (MZ)
\item Make sure the MZ turns on (LEDs light up and all)
\item Make sure the VCCIO banks get 3.3V
\item Check that the various lv07a/lvc07a's all work and that outputs from the MZ
make it through them with decent gain (ie 3.3V signals go to 5V signals)(Note the shift register CLK/Data line may be an excpetion here, more on that later)
\item MZ Happy light is on when MZ is plugged in and turned on
\item MZ Hppy light is off when MZ is unplogged and or off
\end{itemize}
\section{Multiplexer}
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that each the multiplexer turns on/off appropriately
\item Check that each line can be addressed as expected
\end{itemize}
\section {ControlRegister}
\begin{itemize}
\item The 74hct164 can be loaded with arbitrary 8bits.
\item These 8bits don't showup at the  various parts they feed into until the data
ready line is strobed.
\item The 8bits can be read back in in a non-destructive manner
\end{itemize}
\section{GlobalTriggering and GT Delays}
\begin{itemize}
\item Confirm that the GT shows up on TUBii and looks alright (squarish)
\item Sync and Sync 24 show up on Tubii
\item Check that it gets delayed (at all) by the two DS1023s in GT\_Delays section
\item Check that these delays can be changed by loading their shift registers.
\item Check that the daisy chainging of their shift registers works
\item Check that the GT gets to the MZ
\item Check that the MZ is able to count GTs and keep a running GTID
\item Sync and Sync24 show up at MZ
\item MZ can sync up when sync/sync24 show up.
\item The Microzed can choose between DDGT and LO\_MTCD
\item Check the all pulses (GT,DGT,DDGT,LO*) are down-going or up-going as they 
should be. NOTE TO SELF, FIGURE OUT HOW THEY SHOULD BE GOING
\end{itemize}
\section{Clocks}
\subsection{Default Clock Select}
\begin{itemize}
\item Some surgery is needed to get the clock in place. Check that a 200MHZ signal comes out of it at all.
\item Check the the LVPECL pull-down is working well
\item Check that the 200MZ signal gets divided to 100MHZ
\item Clock divider's reset button is working
\item Clock divider reset signal from MZ is working
\item Quality of external TUB clock is good
\item One clock becomes Default and the other becomes backup
\item The clock that is default can be switched with backup and vice versa
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Fault Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The DefaultClock (DefCLK) signal's frequency gets divided and the various jumpers can pick between frequencies.
\item No DefCLK signal makes output of the HCT123 changed.
\item Some noticable change in the system happens when the DefCLK output is missing
\item You can count how many clock pulses get missed. (ie you get 100mhz pulses while the DefCLK is gone and they go away when DefCLK shows up again)
\item The mc10e016 emits a signal if many clock pulses are missed
\item The MC10e016's shift register can be loaded and this allows you to pick
how many pulses until TC does something 
\item The output of that fucking rats nest that hangs off of TC makes at least some sense, good fucking luck buddy.
\item The MZ gets told when the clocks should be changed
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Change Clocks}
\begin{itemize}
\item When physical switch is thrown one way the clock at output is exactly the same
as back up clock
\item When thrown the other way the output clock is the DefCLK unless DefCLK 
ChangeCLK signal is high.
\item The various LEDs light up in a way that makes some sense/is useful
\end{itemize}
\section{Ecal Control}
\begin{itemize}
\item The control register outputs an ECAL\_ACTIVE signal that can be actively
changed by the MZ.
\item The LED corresponding the the ECAL\_ACTIVE signal works
\item When ECAL\_ACTIVE is high the output is GT
\item When ECAL\_ACTIVE is low the output is EXT\_PED\_IN
\end{itemize}
\section{ELLIE}
\begin{itemize}
\item For SMELLIE
	\begin{itemize}
	\item An output pulse can be made at a set-able frequency
	\item This pulse is synchronous with the 100 MHz clock 
	\item An ecl pulse can be read it then delayed by a set-able amount
	\item That pulse is synchronous with the 100MHz clock
	\end{itemize}
	\item For TELLIE
	\begin{itemize}
	\item An output pulse can be made at a set-able frequency
	\item This pulse is synchronous with the 100 MHz clock 
	\item An ECL pulse can be read it then delayed by a set-able amount
	\item That pulse is synchronous with the 100MHz clock

\end{itemize}



\section{MTCA\_MIMIC}
\begin{itemize}
\item DAC can be set by the MZ to output a sensible volatage value
\item The stupid pot can be tuned to output equally sensible voltage values
\item Analog signals get clipped at ~+- 5 volts
\item Comparator outputs signal appropriate signal when Analog Pulse is over/under
 DAC threshold
 \item Comparatoroutputs signal appropriate signal when Analog Pulse is over/under
 POT threshold


\item GT DGT, and LO* all show up as expected.
\item The DGT\_Gate signal makes sense.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Trigger Logic}
\begin{itemize}


\item Comparator outputs high when a signal goes over the DAC value AND the 
physical switch is thrown such that positive going pulses are selected

\item Comparator outputs high when a signal goes over the POT value AND the 
physical switch is thrown such that positive going pulses are selected

\item Comparator outputs high when a signal goes under the DAC value AND the 
physical switch is thrown such that negative going pulses are selected

\item Comparator outputs high when a signal goes under the POT value AND the 
physical switch is thrown such that negaitve going pulses are selected

\item The makeshift ECL One-Shot works

\item A trigger pulse shows up at output at all of the following conditions
no matter what if Analog pulse goes over threshold

\item A trigger pulse shows up at output at about the same time as LO* if analog
pulse went over threshold during DGT\_Gate (between lockout and DGT)


\end{itemize}
