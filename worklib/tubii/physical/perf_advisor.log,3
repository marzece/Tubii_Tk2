Ratsnest schedule check
-------------------------------
* VCC15M net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* VCC15 net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* V3P3 net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* VCC24M net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* VCC24 net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* VTT net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* VEE net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* VCC net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.
* GND net has VOLTAGE property, suggest adding NO_RAT property.

DRC checks
----------------------
* OK.

Constraint region check
-------------------------------
* OK.

Dynamic shape check
-------------------------------
* Dynamic shape has a large number of edges (75).
  Suggest re-entering shape.
  ISSUE: Attempts to detect shapes that might have been changed from
         static to dynamic. Large number of edges leads to quality
         of voiding and performance issues.
      shape/region location:  (2575.0 4250.0)
      layer:                  BOUNDARY/VEE


Sector table check
-------------------------------
* OK.

Constraint set check
---------------------------------
* OK.

NODRC_SYM_SAME_PIN check
---------------------------------
* OK.

Cross section check for bad dielectric constant values
--------------------------------------------------------
* OK.

Padstack size check
----------------------
* OK.

Conductor line check
------------------------------
* OK.
